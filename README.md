# Ok Google, Talk to Code Tutor

[![HitCount](http://hits.dwyl.io/hchiam/code-tutor.svg)](http://hits.dwyl.io/hchiam/code-tutor)

**Code Tutor** is listed in the [Google Assistant web directory](https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/000000668d1fb538).

**Long-term goal**: Let's help people who can't use their hands to learn to code by talking to the Google Assistant.

**For now**: Conversationally teach simple coding concepts. Code hands-free.

Made possible thanks to support from family and friends.

Built using lessons learned from my [mental-temp-converter backend](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/mental-temp-converter) and a [Zeitspace workshop](https://github.com/zeitspace/AssistantAppWorkshop) I attended.

## Use the Google Assistant on Your Phone:

This app works great on a device with a screen. You can get the Google Assistant on your device:

* Android: https://assistant.google.com/intl/en_ca/platforms/phones/
* iPhone/iPad (I haven't tried it): https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/google-assistant/id1220976145

## Files:

I'm open-sourcing my code to help others learn faster (just please change the author in package.json before you publish). It also enables you to help me improve the app by contributing on GitHub.

* [index.js](https://github.com/hchiam/code-tutor/blob/master/index.js) is my inline editor code. You can use it to figure out how to use the inline editor faster in your own projects. For it to work, my code requires the imports listed in 
* [package.json](https://github.com/hchiam/code-tutor/blob/master/package.json) (you’ll see a tab for this in the inline editor). 
* The [CodeTutor](https://github.com/hchiam/code-tutor/tree/master/Code-Tutor) folder is an un-zipped export of my agent from Dialogflow (API.ai), which may contain the app’s intents, entities, and other info besides the other 2 files.
